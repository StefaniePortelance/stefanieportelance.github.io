# Academic Portfolio
### BASc. Mechanical Enigneering Student - University of Ottawa

Welcome to my academic portfolio, where I showcase my engineering projects, research, and technical problem-solving skills. 

As a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Ottawa, I have worked on many projects, from designing an active dynamic spoiler to developing an early warning malt and dust sensor for an industrial brewery. My experience spans structural design, sensor integration, and inclusive engineering, such as creating an accessible play table for children with disabilities. Through coursework and hands-on projects—including my involvement in Formula SAE—I apply system design, aerodynamics, and data acquisition to real-world challenges. Explore my portfolio to see how I bring analytical thinking and creativity to engineering solutions.

Over the past year with Formula Student, I’ve taken on increasingly complex engineering challenges, refining both my technical and problem-solving skills. My primary focus has been on aerodynamics and structural design, where I worked on the development of the sidepods using foam core composites and carbon fiber layups. I also optimized the aerodynamic package, utilizing CFD analysis to assess the performance of our NACA 6412 airfoil and refine the design of the car’s aero elements. Additionally, I contributed to data acquisition efforts, incorporating sensors to measure downforce and temperature for performance evaluation. Beyond technical work, I’ve gained experience in cross-functional collaboration, working closely with other subsystems to integrate aerodynamic and cooling solutions efficiently. This past year has deepened my expertise in motorsports engineering, reinforcing my passion for high-performance vehicle development.
