# Academic Portfolio
### BASc. Mechanical Engineering Student - University of Ottawa

Welcome to my academic portfolio, where I showcase my engineering projects, research, and technical problem-solving skills. 

As a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Ottawa, I have worked on many projects, from designing an active dynamic spoiler to developing an early warning malt and dust sensor for an industrial brewery. My experience spans structural design, sensor integration, and inclusive engineering, such as creating an accessible play table for children with disabilities. Through coursework and hands-on projects—including my involvement in Formula SAE—I apply system design, aerodynamics, and data acquisition to real-world challenges. Explore my portfolio, ordered by most recent completion, to see how I bring analytical thinking and creativity to engineering solutions.

## Formula SAE: My Favorite Team

Over the past year with Formula Student, I’ve taken on increasingly complex engineering challenges, refining both my technical and problem-solving skills. My primary focus has been on aerodynamics and structural design, where I worked on the development of the side pods using foam core composites and carbon fiber layups. I also optimized the aerodynamic package, utilizing CFD analysis to assess the performance of our NACA 6412 airfoil and refine the design of the car’s aero elements. Additionally, I contributed to data acquisition efforts, incorporating sensors to measure downforce and temperature for performance evaluation. Beyond technical work, I’ve gained experience in cross-functional collaboration, working closely with other subsystems to integrate aerodynamic and cooling solutions efficiently. This past year has deepened my expertise in motorsports engineering, reinforcing my passion for high-performance vehicle development.


## Active Dynamic Spoiler: The Making of a _Faster_ Car!
#### uOttawa System Dynamics Course [Sept-Dec 2024]

As part of a course, my team and I developed an active rear aerodynamic spoiler that dynamically adjusts based on velocity, downforce, and drag to optimize performance. The system was modeled with MATLAB simulations and validated against publicly available NASCAR data. By referencing the Circuit of The Americas (COTA) track, we analyzed how the spoiler could improve stability and efficiency across varying track conditions, adjusting for high-speed straights and tight corners. The project required a deep understanding of vehicle aerodynamics, control systems, and system dynamics modeling, making it an exercise in both theoretical analysis and practical application.

For a manufacturing and design course, I worked with a team to develop an accessible play table tailored for a young client with disabilities. Our objective was to create a highly adaptable and inclusive design, featuring:

-Adjustable legs for customizable height configurations, storability, and its _Fun!_(Lego-inspired).
-A spacious tabletop to accommodate various activities and assistive devices.
-Interchangeable mounting surfaces to support different tools and equipment.
-Adjustable surface angles, allowing for better ergonomics and accessibility for users with different mobility needs.

The project combined ergonomic design, user-centered engineering, and manufacturing techniques, demonstrating the intersection of engineering and inclusivity. It also reinforced the importance of direct client engagement to ensure functional and user-friendly solutions.

# Pratt Truss Bridge Construction: A Structural Engineering Success 
#### uOttawa Mechanics of Materials Course [Jan-Apr 2023]

[CVG2140_Final_Report.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19041701/CVG2140_Final_Report.pdf)

From January to March 2023, our team successfully designed and built a Pratt truss bridge, combining theoretical engineering principles with practical application. Through meticulous structural analysis using Euler’s buckling formula and stress equations, we validated the superior load-carrying capacity of the Pratt truss compared to a Howe truss.

Using S-Frame and SolidWorks, we conducted extensive simulations and structural assessments, ensuring optimal stability and weight efficiency. The bridge, weighing just 119.9 grams, remarkably withstood 744 Newtons of force, demonstrating an outstanding strength-to-weight ratio. Precision in craftsmanship, lateral bracing, and quality control techniques like laser leveling contributed to its structural integrity.

This project showcases our expertise in structural design, engineering analysis, and collaborative problem-solving, reinforcing our ability to apply academic knowledge to real-world engineering challenges.
