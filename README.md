# Academic Portfolio

### BASc. Mechanical Engineering Student - University of Ottawa

Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase my engineering projects, research, and technical problem-solving skills. 

As a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Ottawa, I have worked on many projects, from designing an active dynamic spoiler to developing an early warning malt and dust sensor for an industrial brewery. My experience spans structural design, sensor integration, and inclusive engineering, such as creating an accessible play table for children with disabilities. Through coursework and hands-on projects—including my involvement in Formula SAE—I apply system design, aerodynamics, and data acquisition to real-world challenges. Explore my portfolio, ordered by most recent completion, to see how I have been able to bring analytical thinking and creativity to engineering solutions alongside my peers.

# Formula SAE: GeeGee Racing Team
#### Member since February 2024

<img src="assets/image/Amigo_Group_Pic.jpg">

Over the past year, I've been a proud member of the Formula Student Team at the University, and I have been lucky enough to have taken on memorable engineering challenges and projects, refining both my technical and problem-solving skills. Throughout my time on time, my primary focus has been on aerodynamics and structural design, where I worked on developing side pods using foam core composites and carbon fiber layups. I also contributed to data acquisition efforts, incorporating sensors to measure downforce and temperature for performance evaluation.

I am currently focusing on redesigning the undertray for the 2026 model and have taken on utilizing CFD analysis to assess the performance of my design and overall refine the quality of the aerodynamic package. This has allowed me to develop skills in research and data retrieval and has allowed me to be creative in my work, where I find true joy in being an engineering student. Beyond technical work, I’ve gained valuable experience in cross-functional collaboration, working closely with other subteams such as powertrain to integrate aerodynamic and cooling solutions efficiently. This past year has deepened my expertise in motorsports engineering, reinforcing my passion for high-performance vehicle development.


# Active Dynamic Spoiler
#### uOttawa System Dynamics Course [Sept-Dec 2024]

As part of a course, my team and I developed an active rear aerodynamic spoiler that dynamically adjusts based on velocity, downforce, and drag to optimize performance. The system was modeled with MATLAB simulations and validated against publicly available NASCAR data. Through referencing the Circuit of The Americas (COTA) track, we analyzed how the spoiler could improve stability and efficiency across varying track conditions, adjusting for high-speed straights and tight corners. The project required a deep understanding of vehicle aerodynamics, control systems, and system dynamics modeling, making it an exercise in both theoretical analysis and practical application.

# Aerodynamic Data Acquisition System: Research
#### uOttawa Electrical Engineering Course [Sept-Dec 2024]

As part of an aerodynamics-focused data acquisition project, my peer and I designed a system to capture real-time airflow and pressure data for the FSAE race car at uOttawa. The setup integrated differential pressure sensors, force-sensitive resistors (FSRs), and a temperature sensor to analyze downforce, airflow characteristics, and thermal behavior in the aerodynamic package.

Key components included:

-  Pitot tubes and mass flow sensors for measuring static and dynamic air pressure. <br />
-  FSRs mounted on aero surfaces to assess downforce distribution. <br />
-  Temperature sensors for monitoring brake or tire temperature in high-load conditions. <br />
-  Signal conditioning circuits, amplifiers, and filters to process sensor outputs before feeding them into a multiplexer and ADC for digital conversion. <br />

Overall, the project was a success, however, due to time constraints and an unfinished FSAE car, we have yet to apply the sensors to the electrical harness of the car in question. Once the car has been fully manufactured, I hope to be able to apply these sensors to the car to validate CFD simulations and improve the temperature stability / thermal behavior of the car and its brakes. Nevertheless, this project strengthened my expertise in sensor integration, circuit design, and data-driven performance optimization for high-speed vehicle applications.

# Accessible Table Design: Inclusive Engineering
#### uOttawa Project Management Course [Sept-Dec 2023]

For a manufacturing and design course, I worked with a team to develop an accessible play table tailored for a young client with disabilities. Our objective was to create a highly adaptable and inclusive design, featuring:

-  Adjustable legs for customizable height configurations, storability, and its _Fun!_(Lego-inspired). <br />
-  A spacious tabletop to accommodate various activities and assistive devices. <br />
-  Interchangeable mounting surfaces to support different tools and equipment. <br />
-  Adjustable surface angles, allowing for better ergonomics and accessibility for users with different mobility needs.

The project combined ergonomic design, user-centered engineering, and manufacturing techniques, demonstrating the intersection of engineering and inclusivity. It also reinforced the importance of direct client engagement to ensure functional and user-friendly solutions.

# Pratt Truss Bridge Construction: A Structural Engineering Success 
#### uOttawa Mechanics of Materials Course [Jan-Apr 2023]

<img src="assets/image/Bridge_IRL.png">

From January to March 2023, our team successfully designed and built a Pratt truss bridge, combining theoretical engineering principles with practical application. Through meticulous structural analysis using Euler’s buckling formula and stress equations, we validated the superior load-carrying capacity of the Pratt truss compared to a Howe truss.

Using S-Frame and SolidWorks, we conducted extensive simulations and structural assessments, ensuring optimal stability and weight efficiency. The bridge, weighing just 119.9 grams, remarkably withstood 744 Newtons of force, demonstrating an outstanding strength-to-weight ratio. Precision in craftsmanship, lateral bracing, and quality control techniques like laser leveling contributed to its structural integrity.

This project showcases our expertise in structural design, engineering analysis, and collaborative problem-solving, reinforcing our ability to apply academic knowledge to real-world engineering challenges.
